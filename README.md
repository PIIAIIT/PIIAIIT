# About me

I am 25 years old. I am currently studying computer science at the University in Sankt Augustin.

# My Programming Journey

My programming journey began with **Java**, though not under the best circumstances. I followed a low-quality YouTube tutorial on how to make a simple box game—before I even knew what Git was. Needless to say, my first experience wasn’t great.

Later, at university, I revisited **Java** with a stronger foundation. This time, I gained a solid understanding of programming logic, how the CPU interacts with code, and how Java manages memory and variables.

In my second semester, I was introduced to **C**, which gave me a deeper insight into how computers store and manage data. I also tackled the essential (and initially intimidating) concept of pointers.
The Databases lecture taught me how to approach data problems at a relational level, while the **Programming 2** course introduced me to fundamental data structures like `BinaryTree`, `ArrayList`, `Stack`, and others.

In the third semester, I studied **statistics** and **operating systems**—both intellectually stimulating subjects that broadened my perspective.
Courses in **algorithms, graph theory, and data structures** deepened my understanding of problem-solving techniques and algorithmic thinking.
I also took a course in **IT security**, which was especially eye-opening. Understanding where systems are vulnerable and how to protect them is both fascinating and vital.

I'm currently in my fourth semester and working on a custom programming language called ICE as part of a university project.
At the same time, I'm exploring **computability and complexity theory**—challenging, yet incredibly rewarding topics.
I'm also learning about **parallel programming**, working with **threads, OpenMP, and MPI** to understand how modern systems handle concurrency.

Additionally, I'm writing an academic paper for my *Projektseminar*, which will prepare me for my thesis in the sixth semester.
The **Software Engineering 1** course is helping me understand how larger teams collaborate, with concepts like sprints and agile workflows.
Finally, **Web Usability** has taught me to see applications from a user's perspective—something that’s both fun and highly relevant in real-world development.
