# About me

I am 24 years old. I am currently studying computer science at the University in Sankt Augustin.

# My Programming Journey

For the most part of my programming journey, I learned **Python**. The very first programming language I used was **Java**, but my initial experience wasn't ideal. I followed a rather poor YouTube tutorial on how to make a box game. This was before I even used Git.

Now, at university, I revisited **Java**, this time learning it properly. I gained a deeper understanding of the logic behind the language, how the CPU interacts with code, and how **Java** stores and accesses variables.

In my second term, I was introduced to **C**, where I learned more about how a computer stores data, along with the terrifying but essential concept of pointers.

Currently, I am in my third term at university, and I will soon start learning **Python** again—this time for my **Probability and Statistics** class.
